    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>I am a Software Coach currently working at Registers of Scotland. I like learning new technologies and understanding how they can be used to make great products that users like to use. If I were ever to get a pet it would be a border terrier dog as I like their scruffy looking faces.</p>
