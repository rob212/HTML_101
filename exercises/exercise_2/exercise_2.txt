Exercise 1 
-----------
Open the 'my_page.html' found in the 'exercises' folder in a plain text editor, such as Notepad. 
By default if you double click an HTML file then it will open in your deafult Web Browser. In order to open it in your
text editor you will need to right click the file and select 'Open with...' and choose Notepad. 


The HTML already contained in the file is what you start with for every single web page you'll ever produce. 

We can add a title to our web page in the <head> element. Web Browsers display this in the tab for your page. 

Within the <head>...</head> tags in 'my_page.html' add a title element and save the file. 

<title>My Page</title>

Now open the 'my_page.html' file in your Web Browser. You should see your title displaying in the tab (you will see a blank page as we haven't put anything in the HTML body element yet)
