Tags and Elements
------------------

HTML enables us to "markup" our content to give it a meaningful structure. 

An HTML element is defined by a start tag, some content, and an end tag.

<tagName>Content goes here...</tagName>

Some examples of some HTML elements:

<h1>My first heading</h1>
<p>My first paragraph</p>

*Some HTML elements have no content (like the <hr> element). 
These elements are called empty elements and don't have an end tag, we'll cover these later.



Exercise 1 
-----------
Open the 'my_page.html' found in the 'exercises' folder in a plain text editor, such as Notepad. 
By default if you double click an HTML file then it will open in your default Web Browser. In order to open it in your
text editor you will need to right click the file and select 'Open with...' and choose Notepad. 


The HTML already contained in the file is what you start with for every single web page you'll ever produce. 

We can add a title to our web page in the <head> element. Web Browsers display this in the tab for your page. 

Within the <head>...</head> tags in 'my_page.html' add the following title element and save the file. 

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My Page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    
  </body>
</html>


Now open the 'my_page.html' file in your Web Browser. 
You should see your title displaying in the tab (you will see a blank page as we haven't put anything in the HTML body element yet)



If you aren't seeing your title, carefully check your HTML tags are nested in the correct order. It's important to ensure there are no overlapping elements. 
For instance, the <title> element is supposed to be inside of the <head>, so you never want to add the closing </head> tag before closing the </title> tag.
e.g. (DON'T EVER DO THIS)

<head>
    <title>My Page</head>
</title>
